# NLP---Industrial-Chatbot

Industrial Safety NLP Chatbot

This project aims to design a machine learning/deep learning-based chatbot to help professionals highlight safety risks from incident descriptions in an industrial setting. The dataset includes accident records from 12 different plants across 3 countries, detailing the severity of accidents, their potential severity, and the context in which they occurred.
Problem Statement

Industries worldwide face ongoing challenges related to accidents, often leading to severe injuries or fatalities. This project seeks to address the need for a tool that can analyze incident descriptions and predict safety risks.
