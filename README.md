# NLP- Industrial Hazardous Accident Detection-

This project aims to design a machine learning/deep learning-based system to analyze industrial accident records and predict potential safety risks. The dataset includes accident records from 12 different plants across 3 countries, detailing the severity of accidents, their potential severity, and the context in which they occurred.
Problem Statement

Industries worldwide face ongoing challenges related to accidents, often leading to severe injuries or fatalities. This project seeks to address the need for a tool that can analyze incident descriptions and predict safety risks to mitigate future accidents.
Dataset

    Source: Industrial Safety and Health Analytics Database on Kaggle
